# SB-Auto

Makes downloading Scratch projects easy. Simply enter two project IDs and click start. No need to pick the right format or include the assets, all of this is done automatically and in the browser.

## How to use

**1.** Go [here](https://magentasupernova.github.io/SB-Auto/).  
**2.** Enter a project ID to start downloading at.  
**3.** Enter a project ID to stop downloading at.  
**4.** Click `Start!` and wait for the project files to download.  

That's it!
